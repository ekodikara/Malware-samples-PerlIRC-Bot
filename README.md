# WARNING! Malicious Program!
# (For future reference and some one who love to analyse these things)

This will contain all files which I got from the Victim's Server.
(IRC C2 botware (ShellBot), Cryptomining malware.)

# Disclaimer

purpose is to allow the study of malware and enable people who are interested in malware analysis (or maybe even as a part of their job) to have access to live malware, analyse the ways they operate, and maybe even enable advanced and savvy people to block specific malware within their own environment.

Please remember that these are live and dangerous malware! They come encrypted and locked for a reason! Do NOT run them unless you are absolutely sure of what you are doing! They are to be used only for educational purposes (and we mean that!) !!!

I recommend running them in a VM which has no internet connection.

# Assumptions:

Seems like a alsmot all attacked servers have lot of failed SSH login attampts.
